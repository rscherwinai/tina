                Russell created B2B Tracks as an outlet for his passion for go-to-market and innovation. 
                He takes pride in aligning sales, marketing, product, and CS with buyer-centric 
                go-to-market messaging and motions.

                A computer scientist by training, Russell learned early on that creating and capturing 
                value from technology innovation was his passion. Since then, he&apos;s led product, sales, 
                marketing, and CS teams.
